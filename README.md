# Team Generator

## Description

This application was made to help assemble the right team for the job! The Team generator uses Javascript, Node.js, the inquirer NPM package, jest NPM and HTML. It also uses a little CSS, but not required! This application prompts the user with different questions that allows a professional team to be put together. When asking questions about the different positions and information about the employee, there will be a card at the end on a custom HTML page made specifically for that team! The different questions can allow the team to keep in communication with each other having the emails of all involved. When leading a team, organization is important to know the task at hand and know the people who are on your team! This application is bare bones starting for a team organization, and can be much improved in the future, with more features and ways to communicate. 

To use this application, the starting process is shown in this video link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WPRUbIZ8El3cZ8LdVBxB6mKM4Ztvf66u/view?usp=sharing
